    <h3>The best Chicken Burger you'll ever taste!</h3>
        <p>We all know that beef gets the spotlight when it comes to classic burgers, but when it comes to alternatives, chicken burgers can get a bad rap.</p>
        <p>If chicken burgers haven't been your fave in the past, trust us—our easy, flavorful recipe will make you a believer. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 lb. ground chicken</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp. smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 scallions, minced</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine chicken, paprika, garlic, and green onions, and season with salt and pepper. Divide mixture into 4 patties. </li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add burger patties and cook, flipping once, until golden and a thermometer inserted into the center registers 165°, 8 to 10 minutes. Top with cheddar, cover, and cook until just melted, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer patties to a plate. </li>
            <li>Stack lettuce, coleslaw, chicken burgers, avocado, red onion, jalapeño, and more coleslaw on top of bottom buns. Close sandwiches with top buns.</li>
        </ol>
